name: Build Devenv Image
# This workflow builds and publishes a Docker image containing the pre-built
# devenv environment. This speeds up format checks in PRs by eliminating the
# need to install Nix and devenv on every run.
#
# The image is automatically rebuilt when devenv configuration files change.
# You can also manually trigger a rebuild from the Actions tab.
